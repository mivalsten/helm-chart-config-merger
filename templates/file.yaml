# Add this to the start of the file to replace .Values with calculatedValues
{{- $conf := include "helper.calculatedValues" . | fromYaml -}}
{{- with dict "Values" $conf "Release" .Release "Chart" .Chart }}

{{. | toYaml }}

# alternatively, you can also do it like that:
{{- $calc := include "helper.calculatedValues" . | fromYaml -}}

{{ $calc | toYaml }}
